INTRO

D G
I'm waiting at the park and ride

D G
And I don't mind these blue street lights

D G
I'm hanging out for him on Constellation Drive

D G
It's not quite the city but it's not the countryside

F Am D
And the light is changing, the clouds are reshaping themselves into mountains


CHORUS 1 (drums in)

C G F
And I am flying high above the distribution lines That hem the suburbs 

C G F
Down and power the old towns along the highway

C G F
I'm wishing on that car that you haven't changed your mind

C G F
And your winding in the road coming my way

C G F x2


VERSE 1 

D G (double time)
There's an aeroplane and a confident star

D G
There's a big blue sky and a moving car

F Am (regular time)
All these lines of perspective that pulled me to the point

D
I'm hooning down the road with all the dots I've joined (stop, directed)


CHORUS 2 (And I'm flying high above...)
<b></b>


VERSE 2

D G (double time)
There's a confident star and an aeroplane

D G
You sang that I will never be the same 

Am F (regular time)
Again

D (stop, directed timing)
And the yellow pedestrian bridge flies over my head (clomp) on the 18 (clomp)


CHORUS 3 (And I'm flying high above...)


MIDDLE 8

C Dm F G
C Am F G
Am Dm F G
C G F

C G F (drums out, directed)
It's a calling not a question, I've been falling for so long now 

C G Bb F
to this destiny, even when I was going the wrong way, I was coming round

(kick in)
C G F 
C G F

(Drums in)
C G F 
C G F (bass walk)

F G
Never change your mind

F G
Never change your mind
