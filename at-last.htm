VERSE 1

D E 
At last the sky is turning to blue, And I'll take a

D E
Chance and dance on Oaia with you

D E
Tell me how time knows when to go fast and slow down

D E
So frustrating life's little games first you are winning and losing and then

D E
spinning around again


VERSE 2

D E
Everyone is somewhere, along the line

D E
Nobody knows, if the ends join up

D E
If you're still searching, you are alive

D E
And if you're far from perfect, you're one of mine


CHORUS

Bm F#m A E
Sometimes its not about winning it's just about not giving up

Bm F#m A E
I know that sunshine will always be waiting as soon as you choose to look up

Bm F#m A E
This life is a flash in the pan and I want to see you burn bright

Bm F#m D
The way that my heart fires when I get a sense we can bring all these visions to life

A E D E


VERSE 3

D E
Thickening skin, won't prevent the pain

D E
You've got to let the light back in, keep on beginning again  


CHORUS 2


MIDDLE 8 (hi-hat, kick)

D E
Here the suns going down

D E
There it's just climbing around the horison line

Bm F# B
And I wonder, how it looks in your eyes

A E
Does it bring you to life like you did to me?

D E


CHORUS 3

A E D E
