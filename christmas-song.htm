Christmas Song (6/8, 95bpm)
---------------------------


INTRO

B
B F# E x2 (bass walk)
B F# E  x2 (drums in)


VERSE 1

B F# E
The only trees with leaves on are olive and rust

B F# E
I can smell bonfires and lights have gone up

B F# E
Sometimes I like to stare out

B F# E
Into the middle distance that's me working hard right there

B F# E


VERSE 2

B F# E
Projecting onto walls and doors 

B F# E
Dishwasher trays and cutlery drawers

B F# E
Doing my work without pen and paper

B F# E
Wondering if I'll get it all done so i can see you later

B F# E


VERSE 3 

B F# E
Conversations with heros in my head

B F# E
God I hope that I don't lose so much faith that I put their voices to bed

B F# E
Sometimes I get these emergency feelings

B F# E
Like I just need to be with the ones who need me too

B F# E


CHORUS 1

C# E B F#
So come on now take the weight from your shoulders, Just call me up and you know I'll come over

Abm E B F#
We'll talk emergency feelings, The rises, the falls and the hopes now defeated

A F#
<b></b>


VERSE 4

B F# E (bass octaves)
Remember when you marched me to the top of the hill it turned into a bog and quicksand but still

B F# E
I said yes in the bath later on and we drank and we laughed to guiness and jamesons

B F# E (bass walk)

B F# E 
We'd look at the mould on the ceiling like a new constellation

B F# E
Of stars with that feeling


CHORUS 2

C# E B F#
So come on now take the weight from your shoulders, Just call me up and you know I'll come over

Abm E B F#
We'll talk emergency feelings, The rises, the falls and the hopes now defeated

C# E B F#-E
Tears of joy, tears of grief, how's the world spinning so fast into entropy?


INTRO (drums out)


QUIET VERSE 5

B F# E
Let's not film it lets live it and see it under our eyelids when we fall asleep

B F# E

B F# E (bass walk)
Let's look at the mould on the ceiling like a new constellation

B F# E
Of stars with this feeling


CHORUS 3 (drums in)

C# E B F#
So come on now take the weight from your shoulders, Just call me up and you know I'll come over

Abm E B F#
We'll talk emergency feelings, The rises, the falls and the hopes now defeated

C# E B F#
Tears of joy, tears of grief, how's the world spinning so fast?

C# A F#
This is not how I thought it would go beneath the mistletoe


OUTRO
